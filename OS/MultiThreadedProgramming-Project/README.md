<h1> MultiThreadedProgramming Project </h1>

In this project, we'll get familiar with multi-threaded design. We'll apply different color filters to a single image with two different methods (serial and parallel)
and interpret the result. You will notice that multi-threaded programming (if done accordingly) can lead to faster execution time.


<h2> to Run </h2>
In a terminal window simply run "make" and then "./ImageFilters.out ut.bmp". You can delete the unnecessary files in the end with "make clean" commmand.
